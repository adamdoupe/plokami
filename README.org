PLOKAMI is a lispy interface to libpcap built on top of a CFFI portability
layer. Complete bindings to every function in libpcap are in pcap.lisp
although not exported. A higher level lisp-like interface is implemented in
plokami.lisp and documented here.

*Features*
Realtime network packet capture, injection, PCAP dumpfile
reading/writing, BPF, timeouts and operation in non-blocking mode.  Also,
full support for Windows through winpcap but see here. The library has been
tested on SBCL (linux/darwin), ClozureCL and LispWorks (darwin/win32) but
should work on every platform that CFFI supports.

*Performance*
Minimal/non-existent overhead over plain libpcap. Low memory
use with very few dynamic allocations. No GC delays/packet loss due to
garbage collection.

*License*
The code comes with a BSD-style license so you can basically do with it
whatever you want.
